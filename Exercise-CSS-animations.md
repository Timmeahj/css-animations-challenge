- Repository: `css-animations-challenge`
- Type of Challenge: `Learning`
- Duration: `1-2 days`
- Deadline: `dd/mm/yy H:i AM/PM`
- Deployment strategy :
	- Github page
- Team | solo challenge : `solo`


## Learning Objectives
Sometimes when we navigate the web, we come across websites that have flashy animations, shapes or text moving in crazy ways or ... just buttons that change color when you hover over them. All of those are considered animations and you can make it happen using CSS. In this exercise you will learn various techniques oftenly used when developers do CSS animations.

After this challenge you'll be able to:

- make repeating css animations, such as a loading animation.
- add the final touch to pimp up your buttons and links with hover effects.
- create a website that looks much more alive.

## The Mission
We are ChildsPlay, a company that organises summer camps for children. We would like to make our website more attractive to children because it looks really dull and static at this time. So, we need you to take our website to the next level and add some playful animations in there for the kids to appreciate. We do believe in your capabilities as a developer so besides of some features that we really need you are free to add as much life as you want!

### Must-have features

- A shape that repeatedly changes color.
- A title that moves once, then stops where you want it to be.
- A shape that moves and grows / shrinks in size repeatedly.
- A rainbow element, make it go through all the colors of the rainbow.
- Hover manipulation on a button, a shape and an image. Be creative.
- An element where you let your creativity go crazy! Show me what you can do!

### Nice-to-have features

- A loading bar pops up every time I change a page
- A description that appears when I hover over an image

## Deliverables
1. Publish your source code on the GitHub repository.
2. Publish your github page.

### Steps
1. Create the repository
2. Study the request (What & Why ?)
3. Identify technical challenges (How ?)
4. UX Prototype
...

## Evaluation criterias
1. Everything looks as if it was intended to be like that
2. There are no boring buttons / links anymore, just changing the color on hover is fine.
3. Separation of concerns: I did not add any styling in the HTML file(s).
4. Everything works on different browsers! Take care, sometimes a browser handles an animation differently!

## Have fun!

Now unleash your creativity! I believe in all of you :heart:
