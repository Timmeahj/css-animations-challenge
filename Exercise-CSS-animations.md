## Learning Objectives
Sometimes when we navigate the web, we come across websites that have flashy animations, shapes or text moving in crazy ways or ... just buttons that change color when you hover over them. All of those are considered animations and you can make it happen using CSS. In this exercise you will learn various techniques oftenly used when developers do CSS animations.

After this challenge you'll be able to:

- create animations using CSS
- add the final touch to pimp up your buttons and links with hover effects.
- create a website that looks much more alive.

## The Mission
We are ChildsPlay, a company that organises summer camps for children. We would like to make our website more attractive to children because it looks really dull and static at this time. So, we need you to take our website to the next level and add some playful animations in there for the kids to appreciate. We do believe in your capabilities as a developer so besides of some features that we really need you are free to add as much life as you want!
