- Duration : 1-2 days.

## Let's make some shapes!

### Introduction 

Sometimes when we navigate the web, we come across websites that have flashy animations, shapes or text moving in crazy ways or ... just buttons that change color when you hover over them. All of those are considered animations and you can make it happen using CSS. In this exercise you will learn various techniques oftenly used when developers do CSS animations.

#### Objectives

The goal of this exercise is to make you comfortable with CSS animations so you can use them in your own way and implement them using your own style. You will make a onepager that contains the following elements:

- A shape that repeatedly changes color.
- A title that moves once, then stops where you want it to be.
- A shape that moves and grows / shrinks in size repeatedly.
- Hover manipulation on a button, a shape and an image. Be creative.
- An element where you let your creativity go crazy! Show me what you can do!

You will learn how to do all that stuff in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHUpx90NerM) which is the same as the one linked on top.

Get creative and good luck!
